    <h3> Switzerland</h3>
    <p>Switzerland was formed in 1291 by an alliance of cantons against the Habsburg dynasty—the Confoederatio Helvetica
        (or Swiss Confederation), from which the abbreviation CH for Switzerland derives—though only in 1848, when a new
        constitution was adopted, was the present nation formed. Prior to 1848, internal conflict was quite common, but
        Switzerland has enjoyed relative domestic tranquility since the mid-19th century, and its organization has
        remained essentially the same: it is a union of more than 3,000 communes, or municipalities, situated in 26
        cantons, 6 of which are traditionally referred to as demicantons (half cantons) but function as full cantons.
        Ordinary citizens are able to participate at every level of politics and regularly exercise their will in
        referenda and initiatives, through which Swiss citizens directly make numerous policy decisions at the national
        and subnational level. Two effects of this popular involvement are evident: Swiss taxes are rather low by
        European standards, because voters are able to review and approve a broad range of expenditures, and political
        decision making tends to be slow, because contending individual claims and opinions must be allowed to be
        expressed at every step.
