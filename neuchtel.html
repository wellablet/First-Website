    <h3>Neuchâtel</h3>
    <p>Neuchatel is not only a city but also the capital of the canton of Neuchatel. The pleasant city is situated in
        the middle of vineyards and has a medieval heart. Alexander Dumas once said that the pale ochre houses were
        caved out of a pat of butter. Neuchatel has even its own lake, the largest lake located entirely in Switzerland.
        15 km (9.3 miles) of accessible shores invite all kind of water activities. The canals join with Lake Biel and
        Lake Murten.

        The name Neuchatel is derived from a structure built as a stronghold in the second period of Burgundian rule.
        The town then became the property of the French Orleans-Longueville family by inheritance. Again by inheritance,
        Neuchatel became the personal property of the King of Prussia after 1707. Its intellectual and cultural life
        blossomed and the ideas of the Encyclopaedists flourished there. Neuchatel then joined the Swiss Confederation
        in 1815 and got into a peculiar political position. It became a Swiss canton while remaining bound to the King
        of Prussia. Neuchatel is well known for its watch making, vineyards and of being one of five sites of the Expo
        02, the sixth Swiss national exhibition held in summer 2002.
